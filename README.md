### Hi!! 👋

🌱 I'm Ian, a forest ecologist and remote sensing scientist. Currently I'm a Postdoctoral Associate at [Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies](https://www.caryinstitute.org/), where I'm using near and satellite remote sensing to understand how lightning impacts tropical forest mortality and biodiversity.

🌎 During my PhD in [Geospatial Analytics](https://cnr.ncsu.edu/geospatial/) at North Carolina State University, I was a NASA Future Investigator researching how best to improve near real-time forest disturbance monitoring using multi-source satellite data. This involved a mix of Google Earth Engine, R, and some Python. Prior to immersing myself in remote sensing, I worked with the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute ([SCBI](https://nationalzoo.si.edu/conservation)) as a forest ecology research analyst in a long-term ecological monitoring plot ([ForestGEO](https://forestgeo.si.edu/sites/north-america/smithsonian-conservation-biology-institute)). My MSc dissertation from Oxford's [School of Geography and the Environment](https://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/) found me assessing prescribed fire practices in central Gabon.
